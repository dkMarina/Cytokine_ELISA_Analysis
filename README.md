# Cytokine ELISA Analysis (Simulated Data)

This mini-project simulates cytokine concentration data (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha) measured under control and stimulated conditions, mimicking ELISA-based immunological assays. It was created to demonstrate basic data analysis and visualization skills in R using tidyverse tools.

## Purpose

To demonstrate:
- R proficiency with data wrangling and visualization
- Understanding of immunological assay analysis (e.g., ELISA)
- Communication of biological insights from experimental data

## Simulated Experimental Setup

- 3 cytokines: IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma  
- Two conditions: Control vs. Stimulated  
- 10 replicates per condition and cytokine

## What the Script Does

1. **Loads and previews the dataset**
2. **Performs descriptive statistics** (mean, SD)
3. **Generates boxplots** for each cytokine
4. **Conducts basic t-tests** to compare Control vs. Stimulated groups

## About Me

I'm a recent BSc graduate in Molecular Biotechnology with practical lab experience, including an international research internship in immunology. This project is part of my creative portfolio to demonstrate how I connect scientific understanding with practical data analysis skills.
